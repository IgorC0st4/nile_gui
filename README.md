# nile_gui
A flutter based GUI for the <a href="https://github.com/imLinguin/nile">Nile CLI tool</a>

## Inspiration
I thought it was a burden to search an available game's description on the web and manually manage the game installation, so I created this project.

## WARNING
This is a hobby project so it has some problems. If you have a suggestion please open an issue.

## Implemented
 - Clone nile latest branch
 - Authentication process
 - Sync game library
 - Install game
 - Create game runner script (bottles or wine)
 - Create desktop shortcut to execute runner script

## TODO
 - Run game through client (games already can be started using the desktop shortcut)
 - Filter installed games
 - Search game library
 - Uninstall game and related files
